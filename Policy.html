                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                <ul>
                <li>All sales of prebuilt systems are considered final. We do not accept refunds or returns once a transaction is completed. Customers are encouraged to thoroughly inspect the product before finalizing the purchase.</li>

                <ul>
                <li>Parts over $100 will not be covered under warranty unless it is conclusively determined that DubTech is at fault for the damage.

                <ul>
                <li>Free repair benefits are limited to a one-time use for prebuilts with defective parts not caused by DubTech. This can also only be claimed if you bought a prebuilt system and the part came to you not working. Although we will try to always test your system before giving it to you, in case of this happening we have this policy in place. Users must return the faulty part along with proof of purchase to avail themselves of this offer.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Repair Damage Accountability:</h3>
                <ol start="9">

                <p><strong>DubTech&rsquo;s Fault:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <p><strong>Unmet Expectations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>DubTech aims to meet or exceed customer expectations. However, users should be aware that DubTech is not liable for any prebuilt or repair that does not meet their personal expectations. It is our practice to thoroughly discuss and confirm all requirements before finalizing a purchase.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                <li>By putting down your downpayment you agree to paying the rest of the money once I am done with my service. After the services you have 15 days to pay the rest of the money.
